// have to load a single css file for Angular Material in your app.
// Be sure that you only ever include this mixin once!

// Define the palettes for your theme using the Material Design palettes available in palette.scss
// (imported above). For each palette, you can optionally specify a default, lighter, and darker
// hue. Available color palettes: https://material.io/design/color/

// Create the theme object (a Sass map containing all of the palettes).
$commando-app-theme: mat-light-theme($commando-app-primary, $commando-app-accent, $commando-app-warn);

// Include theme styles for core and each component used in your app.
// Alternatively, you can import and @include the theme mixins for each component
// that you are using.
