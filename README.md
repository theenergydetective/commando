# TED Commando  
TED Commando is a simple web server application to allow TED 5000, TED Home, and TED Pro systmes to post energy data that can be exported.  
  
## Installation  

### Digital Ocean

## Manually Running (Desktop)  
  
### Prerequisites  
 - OpenJDK 11+ (https://https://openjdk.java.net/)
  
### Windows  
- Download commando-1.0.jar   
- Create the following directories on the same drive as <i>commando-1.0.jar</i>
	**_`/opt/data`_**
	 **_`/var/log`_**  
  
- From the directory that contains <i>commando-1.0.jar</i>, start the application using the following command:
**_`java -jar commando-1.0.jar -Dspring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:file:C:/opt/data/commando`_**  
  
- Configure the application server by going to the URL: http://<ip of server>:8080   e.g. http://192.168.10.10:8080

### LINUX  
- Download commando-1.0.jar   
- Create the directory: **_`/opt/data`_**
- From the directory that contains <i>commando-1.0.jar</i>, start the application using the following command:
**_`sudo ./commando-1.0.jar`_**  
- Configure the application server by going to the URL: http://<ip of server>:8080   e.g. http://192.168.10.10:8080


### Server Properties
There are several properties that can be overridden from the default. To do this, create a file named 'applicaiton.properties'
and place it in the same directory as the <i>commando-1.0.jar</i> file.  

#### Database Path (spring.datasource.url) 
To change the path of the database, define the <i>spring.datasource.url</i> property. 
e.g. **_`spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:file:/opt/data/commando`_**   If running under Windows, the drive letter must be 
included. e.g. **_`spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:file:C:/opt/data/commando`_**  The default database path is '/opt/data/commando'  

#### Default  Port (server.port)
To change the default port of the server, use the following option:
  **_`server.port=<port>`_** e.g.   **_`server.port=80`_** The default port is 8080

#### Backup Directory (spring.datasource.backup.directory)
The server will create a rolling backup of the database every night at 1:00am of the server's local time. To change 
the location of this directory, use the option:   **_`spring.datasource.backup.directory=<path to database>`_**   
e.g. **_`spring.datasource.backup.directory=/opt/data/backup`_**  

#### Backup Directory (spring.datasource.backup.count)
The server will create a rolling backup of the database every night at 1:00am of the server's local time. To change
number of backups it will maintain use the option  **_`spring.datasource.backup.count=<count>`_**   
e.g. **_`spring.datasource.backup.count=7`_**  By default, 7 backup files will be created.  
  
##### Sample application properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:file:/opt/data/commando
    spring.datasource.backup.path=/opt/data/backup
    spring.datasource.backup.count=7
    server.port=8080
  
### TLS Support
By default the server does not use TLS to encrypt data. To encrypt data, we suggest using <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache HTTP2</a> and a free certificate generated by <a href="[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-apache-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-18-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-apache-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-18-04)">LetsEncrypt</a>.  <b>NOTE:</b> The TED devices are NOT able to post using TLS. You will need to allow them to post over a standard HTTP connection. Therefore, you should not select the option to automatically redirect traffic from HTTP to HTTPS . 

#### ProxyPass
In order to allow Apache Traffic to route traffic to the <i>Commando</i> server, you will need to set up ProxyPass to allow the traffic to be pass through.  Add these lines to your apache2.conf or virtual domain site file. 

    ProxyRequests Off
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass /api/ http://localhost:8080/api/ retry=0
    ProxyPassReverse /api/ http://localhost:8080/api/
    ProxyPass /oauth/ http://localhost:8080/oauth/ retry=0
    ProxyPassReverse /oauth/ http://localhost:8080/oauth/

### Prerequisites  
- Nodejs (https://nodejs.org) - This was originally build using 12.16.3LTS but new versions should be fine.  
- Angular CLI (https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)  
- OpenJDK 11+ (https://https://openjdk.java.net/)  
  
### Windows Notes  
  
- If developing on Windows, you must pass the following property as a VM option as H2 requires and absolute path.  
  
**_`-Dspring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:file:C:/opt/data/commando`_**  
  
- If using WSL for Angular/Node, then the maven command line must be run from there as well.  
   
  
### How to Build  
- Clone or download the source code and extract it.  
- Start in the root Commando directory (same directory as pom.xml)  
- Be sure all of the pre-requisits are installed.  
- After node is installed, run **_`npm install`_** from the **_`commando/src/main/resources/frontend/command-app`_** directory.  
- Run the following from the command prompt: **_` mvn clean package install -DskipTests `_**
